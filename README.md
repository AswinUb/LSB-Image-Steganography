# LSB Image Steganography
 LSB (Least Significant Bit) Image Steganography is a technique used to hide secret data inside an image file by modifying the least significant bits of the pixel values. This project implements LSB steganography in C to embed and extract hidden messages within a BMP (Bitmap) image file.
